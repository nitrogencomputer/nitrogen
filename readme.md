# Nitrogen
Nitrogen is been built as an experimental LayerOne blockchain framework with simplicity in mind. apparently this project stems from a product of a research work which would undergo solo testing first and contributor reviews before even being launched as a v0.0.1 product.

> [!NOTE]  
>
> This is a research work and should not be considered fit for any type of production level work or testing. this product would likely take several months to get completed. so it is regarded as a WIP. The underlying use case of this blockchain framework is as simple as it goes, basically the core use case of this blockchain is to serve for two purposes, ```Banking transactions``` and ```medical transactions``` purposes.
